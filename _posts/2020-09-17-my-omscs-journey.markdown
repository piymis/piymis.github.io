I had started with my Masters in Computer Science from GeorgiaTech this summer. I had taken Introduction to Operating Systems as my first course in the program (CS 6200). This course is one of the highly rated courses in the program and now I can see it why. The lectures are very polished and the material is quite broad and depth. 

### Projects

There are a total of three projects in this course. The first two being in C. The last one is in C++.
