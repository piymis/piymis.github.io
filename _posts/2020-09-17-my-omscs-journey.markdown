I had started with my Masters in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology this summer (May 2020). I had taken Introduction to Operating Systems as my first course in the program (CS 6200). I am currently enrolled in my second semester in the course Advanced Operating System (CS 6210).

The journey so far has been mixed, ranging from happiness to despair at times. The balance between work, study, and life has been a challenge thus far.

I have found the courses to be challenging but quite rewarding in terms of the knowledge and skills I can get from them.

### Future Courses

Below are the courses I am interested to take in the future.

Surely:

* Artificial Intelligence: Classic AI course.

* Intro to High-Performance Computing: More about parallel and distributed computing algorithms.

* Machine Learning: Classic ML survey course.

* Graduate Algorithms: Graduate course on Algorithms.

* Deep Learning: A newly developed course in association with Facebook to study the popular deep learning theory.

* Compilers: Classical compilers course with some bits of automata theory.

* Big Data for Health Informatics: More like a Bootcamp of big data technologies and frameworks.

Unsure:

* Video Game Design: Newly offered course involves designing and developing 3d games using unity.

* Computer Networks: Advanced computer network course.

* Introduction to Information Security: Information security practical applications.

* High-Performance Computer Architecture

* Distributed Systems (Course still in development by Prof. Ada)

There are more than ten courses in the list above and one needs a total of 10 courses to graduate but I am considering taking more of these courses even after I graduate to keep the learning.
