I had started with my Masters in Computer Science from the Georgia Institute of Technology this summer. I had taken Introduction to Operating Systems as my first course in the program (CS 6200). I am currently enrolled in my second semester in the course Advanced Operating System (CS 6210). 

The journey so far has been mixed, ranging from happiness to despair at times. The balance between work, study, and life has been a challenge thus far. 

I have found the courses to be challenging but quite rewarding in terms of the knowledge and skills I am able to get from them.
