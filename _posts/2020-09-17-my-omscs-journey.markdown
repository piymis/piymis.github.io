I had started with my Masters in Computer Science from GeorgiaTech this summer. I had taken Introduction to Operating Systems as my first course in the program (CS 6200). This course is one of the highly rated courses in the program and now I can see it why. The lectures are very polished and the material is quite broad and depth. 

### Projects

There are a total of three projects in this course. The first two being in C. The last one is in C++.
1. The first project is basically the implementation of a multithreaded HTTP like file transfer protocol named GETFILE.
2. The second project is the extension of the first one and here we are to implement the caching server for the server in the previous portion.
3. The third project is the implementation of a distributed file system using gRPC in C++. This was the hardest one for me and I wasn't able to complete it due to the time constraints.
