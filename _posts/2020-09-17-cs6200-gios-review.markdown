CS 6200 (Introduction to Operating System) also known as GIOS is one of the highly rated courses in the program and now I can see it why. The lectures are very polished and the material is quite broad and depth. 
Below is my review of the course when I took in the summer of 2020.

### Projects

There are a total of three projects in this course. The first two being in C. The last one is in C++.
1. The first project is the implementation of a multithreaded HTTP like file transfer protocol named GETFILE.
2. The second project is the extension of the first one and here we are to implement the caching server for the server in the previous portion.
3. The third project is the implementation of a distributed file system using gRPC in C++. This was the hardest one for me and I wasn't able to complete it due to the time constraints.

### Exams

There are two exams in the course a midterm and a final. The midterm covers the first two units of lectures and the rest is covered in the final. The exams are mostly objective answer questions. I found the midterm to be moderate in difficulty but the final was certainly on the harder side of difficulty.
