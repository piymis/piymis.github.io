I am planning on revisiting and learning more about various design patterns such as objected-oriented design patterns, cloud design patterns, etc.

I plan to publish my notes in a format that is easier to digest for anyone revisiting them or looking for a broader overview. 
I am thinking about covering them each in a Blog post with a GitHub repo having all the code for reference. So do check back if you might be interested in the material.
