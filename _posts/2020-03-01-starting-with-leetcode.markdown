I had started my leetcode journey last year. Now I have picked it up again and the plan is to make it a regular habit. I have currently solved 70 odd problems there, mostly the easy ones. I plan on doing around 40 problems a week, comprising a mix of easy and medium problems. Also I am using EPI as the study guide for these algorithmic problems.
